# What's new in Exchange admin center

We're continuously adding new features to Exchange admin center (EAC), fixing issues as we learn about them, and making changes based on your feedback. On this page, you can find highlights of all the recent changes we've made. Some features get rolled out at different times to our customers, so if you are not seeing a new feature yet, keep checking back.

Exchange admin center now uses a new portal at [https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com). This is a modern, web-based management console for managing Exchange, designed to provide an experience that is more aligned with the overall Microsoft 365 admin experience.

For now, it is possible to switch back to the existing EAC (often called the "classic" EAC), but at a future date, the classic EAC will be retired.

## July 2020

Here are some of the changes and new features we introduced in the modern EAC in July 2020.

### Mail flow Reports

Exchange admins can now use the existing dashboard to choose from new variety of mail flow cards that personalize their experience for ease of use and better productivity. To access this dashboard, go to the Exchange Admin Center and select Add Card (+) to see the new cards. 

Discover and understand some more trends related to mail flow in your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization. The following report were already available in the Security & Compliance Center (SCC) portal but are now available in the EAC for added convenience. 

- **Top domain mail-flow status report**: To identify and troubleshoot domains with mail flow issues. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mfi-domain-mail-flow-status-insight?view=o365-worldwide).

- **Queued messages report**: To check those messages that are queued for more than 1 hour and were sent through connectors from your Microsoft cloud org. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mfi-queue-alerts-and-queues?view=o365-worldwide).

- **SMTP AUTH clients report**: To check for unusual activity and TLS used by clients or devices using SMTP AUTH. SMTP AUTH client submission protocol only offers basic authentication and is a less-secure protocol used by devices, such as printers, to send email messages. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mfi-smtp-auth-clients-report?view=o365-worldwide).

### Alerts

Exchange admins can now click on Alerts on the left nav to find report that shows messages from your on-premises organization where the sender's email domain isn't configured as an accepted domain in Office 365. 

These alert reports are system generated reports and will be shown only to priority accounts and VIP accounts.

## June 2020

Here are some of the changes and new features we introduced in the modern EAC in June 2020.

### Manager and directs

Microsoft 365 administrators can now add **Manager** and **Direct reports** for individual mailboxes. Admins can manage this organizational information in the **Accounts** tab in the **Detail** panel.

### Custom attributes

Admins can include fifteen extension attributes that they can use to add information about a recipient, such as an employee ID, organizational unit (OU), or some other custom value for which there isn't an existing attribute.

### G-Suite automation

Admins can migrate batches of users from G Suite to Microsoft 365. In order to move the mailboxes from G Suite to Microsoft 365, there is a series of steps that admins need to perform in G Suite in order to establish the connection between the two environments. The new EAC aims to help the admins automate those steps to make the process easier and more convenient.

## May 2020

Here are some of the changes and new features we introduced in the modern EAC in May 2020.

### Delete shared mailbox

In the modern EAC, Microsoft 365 administrators can now delete an already existing shared mailbox. Admins can also select multiple shared mailboxes and choose the **Delete** button in the command bar to bulk delete them.

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new-2020-05-1-delete-shared.png" alt-text="Screen capture of deleting shared mailboxes":::

### Set default message size restriction

Message size limits control the size of messages that a user can send and receive. By default, when a mailbox is created, there isn't a size limit for sent and received messages. However, admins can use this control to set a default limit. This limit will be applied to any new mailboxes created in the Exchange environment.

:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new-2020-05-2-msgsize-restriction.png" alt-text="Screen shot of setting message size restrictions":::

### Export to .csv

Admins can now click on the **Export** button in the command bar to prepare a .csv file lists all of the mailboxes residing in Exchange Online.

## April 2020

Here are some of the changes and new features we introduced in the modern EAC in April 2020.

### Contacts

Admins now have a new experience when managing contacts for people outside the organization. Admins can create and manage mail contacts and mail users with external email addresses.

### Column chooser

Admins can now customize the columns that appear in the EAC.

### People picker for remote migration

A very common request from our customers was to bring back the people picker for a remote migration scenario. This helps admins to move the selected mailboxes to Exchange online.

### Personalized Dashboard and Reports

- **Migration report**: Learn about the status of the migration batches in your Exchange environment.

  - **Inbound & outbound messages details**: Monitor message volume and TLS encryption for each connector. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/mfi-outbound-and-inbound-mail-flow).

## March 2020

Here are some of the changes and new features we introduced in the modern EAC in March 2020.

#### Recipients

In the modern EAC, the user and shared mailbox management experiences are now merged, and the mailbox list and properties are available on the same page. The option to filter mailboxes based on type can be found on the top right.

Resources experience has been simplified for managing room and resource mailboxes.

#### Migration

Migration is now a first-class citizen under the Modern EAC and is no longer buried inside the Recipient tab as it was in the classic EAC. The major feature additions to the migration flow are:

  - The Exchange and G-Suite migrations are now simple, wizard-based experiences.
  - The G-Suite migration supports migrating Calendar and Contact data along with emails.
  - For G-Suite migration, the 2GB per mailbox per day restriction has been removed.

  - Accepted domains
  - Remote domains
  - Connectors
